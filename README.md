# My_India_App

Welcome to my app. This is small shoping app that I created in one day. I have used React and also Redux for better data management and tailwind css for all the design and responsivenss.
This is an PWA(Progressive Web App). I have used ServiceWorker for this purpose.
It has two pages
1.Product Listing Page
2. Cart Page
This app is deployed in Netlify. This whole app is responsive for all devices.
